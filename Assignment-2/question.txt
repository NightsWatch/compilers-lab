Problem #2(a).

Take a language which is a subset of C. You may take any other language
(or its subset). Define its alphabets and the tokens using regular
expressions.

Take a sample program in the language you have considered. Perform lexical
analysis for the program and generate the symbol table. Also, your lexical
analysis module should have error detection capability.

The problem defined above describes ONLY the basic requirements. You are
free to implement in your own way for efficiency in implementation.
However, you must remember that computation power should not be more than
that of DFA. Extra credits will be given for â€œefficiency in "implementation".


Problem #2(b).
Implement a Lexical analyzer using FLEX for the same language language
considered above.
